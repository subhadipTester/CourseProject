# CourseProject
Create a repository  (preferably GitHub) and copy the sample app code in it. (You can download the code base for the node application from the bottom of this segment). Note that this is a simple demo node application with just 1 API defined. 
Write Dockerfile to dockerise the node application. This file should be able to install dependencies for the application and expose the application on port 8080 
Created a private git repository to store the node application code base and the docker file
Test docker build and run on your local system
Push the docker file of the node application in the same GitHub repository.
